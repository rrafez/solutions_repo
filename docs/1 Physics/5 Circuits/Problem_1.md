#  Circuits â€” Problem 1  
#  Equivalent Resistance Using Graph Theory

## ðŸ“˜ Motivation

Calculating the **equivalent resistance** of a circuit is essential in understanding current flow, power distribution, and network behavior. For simple circuits, we can use well-known rules:

- Series: $R_{\text{eq}} = R_1 + R_2 + \dots + R_n$
- Parallel: $\displaystyle \frac{1}{R_{\text{eq}}} = \frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2} + \dots + \frac{1}{R_n}$

However, as circuits grow complex, identifying these combinations becomes harder.

###  Graph Theory Approach

- Treat each **node** (junction) as a **vertex**
- Treat each **resistor** as an **edge** with a weight equal to its resistance
- Use **graph simplification algorithms** to reduce the graph

This approach allows automatic, programmable simplification of circuits, even with **nested** and **cyclical** resistor networks.

##  Mathematical Basis

Given a graph $G = (V, E)$:
- $V$ is the set of nodes
- $E$ is the set of edges, each with a weight $R_i$ (resistance)

We compute **equivalent resistance** between two nodes $a$ and $b$ using **Y-Î” transforms**, **series/parallel reduction**, or **Kirchhoff's laws** formulated in matrix form.

We model the circuit as a **weighted undirected graph** and systematically reduce it using basic rules:

### ðŸ”§ Series Rule
If two resistors $R_1$ and $R_2$ connect in series:

$$
R_{\text{eq}} = R_1 + R_2
$$

### ðŸ”Œ Parallel Rule
If they connect in parallel:

$$
\frac{1}{R_{\text{eq}}} = \frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2}
\Rightarrow
R_{\text{eq}} = \left( \frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2} \right)^{-1}
$$

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

# Create a circuit graph using networkx
G = nx.Graph()

# Add nodes (representing junctions in the circuit)
nodes = ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E']
G.add_nodes_from(nodes)

# Add edges (representing resistors with resistance values as weights)
# Format: G.add_edge(node1, node2, weight=resistance)
G.add_edge('A', 'B', weight=10)  # Resistor between A and B with 10 Ohms
G.add_edge('B', 'C', weight=20)  # Resistor between B and C with 20 Ohms
G.add_edge('C', 'D', weight=30)  # Resistor between C and D with 30 Ohms
G.add_edge('D', 'E', weight=40)  # Resistor between D and E with 40 Ohms
G.add_edge('A', 'E', weight=50)  # Resistor between A and E with 50 Ohms
