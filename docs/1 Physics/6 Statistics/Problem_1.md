#  Statistics â€” Problem 1  
# Central Limit Theorem Through Simulations

##  Motivation

The **Central Limit Theorem (CLT)** is one of the most important results in probability theory and statistics. It states:

> Given a sufficiently large sample size $n$, the sampling distribution of the sample mean $\bar{x}$ will tend to follow a **normal distribution**, regardless of the shape of the population distribution.

This is powerful because it allows us to make inferences about population means using normal probability methods â€” even when the population distribution is not normal.

In this notebook, we explore the CLT **empirically** by simulating data from different types of distributions and analyzing the distribution of sample means for varying sample sizes.

##  Mathematical Framework

### Central Limit Theorem Formal Statement

Let $X_1, X_2, \dots, X_n$ be a random sample of size $n$ drawn from any population with:

- Finite mean $\mu$
- Finite variance $\sigma^2$

Then, the distribution of the standardized sample mean:

$$
Z = \frac{\bar{X} - \mu}{\sigma / \sqrt{n}}
$$

approaches the standard normal distribution $N(0,1)$ as $n \to \infty$.

##  Simulation Plan

We will:

- Generate large populations from three different distributions:
  - **Uniform**
  - **Exponential**
  - **Binomial**
- Draw repeated samples of different sizes ($n = 5, 10, 30, 50$)
- Calculate the mean of each sample
- Plot the distribution of these sample means
- Observe how the distribution evolves as $n$ increases
