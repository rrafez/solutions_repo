# Problem 1

## Simulating the Effects of the Lorentz Force

### Motivation
The Lorentz force plays a fundamental role in electromagnetism, governing the motion of charged particles in electric and magnetic fields. Understanding this force is crucial in applications like particle accelerators, mass spectrometers, and plasma confinement systems.

---

## Key Equations
The Lorentz force equation is:

$$
\vec{F} = q(\vec{E} + \vec{v} \times \vec{B})
$$

Where:

- \( q \) = charge of the particle
- \( \vec{E} \) = electric field
- \( \vec{B} \) = magnetic field
- \( \vec{v} \) = velocity of the particle

---

## Exploration of Applications

Identify systems where the Lorentz force plays a key role. Some examples include:

- Particle accelerators
- Mass spectrometers
- Plasma confinement systems

Discuss the relevance of electric \( \vec{E} \) and magnetic \( \vec{B} \) fields in controlling the motion of charged particles.

## Simulating Particle Motion

### Simulation Requirements
Implement a simulation to compute and visualize the trajectory of a charged particle under various field conditions:

1. A uniform magnetic field.
2. Combined uniform electric and magnetic fields.
3. Crossed electric and magnetic fields.

Simulate the particleâ€™s motion, which could be circular, helical, or drift, based on initial conditions and field configurations.

---

## Parameter Exploration

Allow variations in the following parameters:

- Field strengths \( E \), \( B \)
- Initial particle velocity \( \vec{v} \)
- Charge and mass of the particle \( q \), \( m \)

Observe how these parameters influence the particle's trajectory.
